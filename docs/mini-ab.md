# Mini-Afterburner

The assembly process for the mini-afterburner is identical to that of the Voron V0, so at this time please refer to that excellent documentation for assembly instructions. [V0 docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/Voron0.1/Manuals/Assembly_Manual_0.1.pdf) page #104

# Mini-Stealthburner

The assembly process for the mini-stealthburner is identical to that of the Voron V0, so at this time please refer to that excellent documentation for assembly instructions. [V0 docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/Voron0.2/Manuals/VORON_V0.2_Assembly_Manual.pdf) page #150

Note you will use the SF Stealthburner body from [Here](STL/Toolhead/Mini_Stealthburner/SaladFork_Mini_Stealthburner_Body.stl) but all additional parts will come from [The Voron-0 Repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/tree/Voron0.2/STLs/Toolheads/Mini_Stealthburner)


## Misc

- The documentation says `Refer to the BOM for lubricant options.`, however lubricants are no longer listed in the BOM. EP2 or preferably Super Lube is appropriate for lubricating the bearings.
- If using a CANbus Toolhead board, [this repo](https://github.com/KayosMaker/CANboard_Mounts/) will likely be useful for custom standoffs and toolhead mounts you will require.
