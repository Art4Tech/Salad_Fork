# Attach the back panel

**Parts needed:**
* 1 3mm pre-cut rear panel
* 3mm thick foam tape
* 10 M3x10 BHCS
* 6 M3 nuts

**Steps:**

1. Line the edges of the rear panel with 3mm foam
2. Preload 3 M3 nuts into the rear of the two extrusion J's in the rear of the printer
3. Mount the rear panel using the M3x10 BHCS. These should squish the foam slightly to make a nice seal to the frame. The highlights in this image show the location of the foam

# Attach the top panel

**Parts needed:**
* 1 3mm pre-cut acrylic top panel
* 3mm thick foam tape

**Steps:**
1. Line the edges of the acrylic panel with the 3mm foam
2. Center the acrylic panel on the top of the frame
3. Add a small bit of VHB tape to the inside of the panel_corner pieces, 2-3cm long
4. Using the M3x12 BHCS, add the panel_corner pieces to the printer. The VHB tape will stick to the acrylic panel keeping the corners in place when the panel is removed.
