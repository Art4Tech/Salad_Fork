# Introduction

![](/images/whole_printer_small.png)    


**This is a work in progress. It *will* change.** The plan is to first complete a basic end to end sequence to document the build order, and then come back to further document and simplify the build steps

A note to experienced builders: Because of the need to preload nuts instead of using roll-ins like on a 2020-based printer, the build order is important to avoid redoing work. While this document is in development things are not 100% set yet but the rough order should be correct

# General notes
* If your kit includes machined nut rails those are preferable to the printed parts and should be used instead

## Conventions used in this document
* BHCS - Button head cap screw
* SHCS - Socket head cap screw
