# Klicky dock mount

**Parts needed:**
* 2 M3 heatsets 
* 2 M3x8 BHCS

**Printed parts:**
* 1 dock_mount


**Steps:**
1. Insert two M3 heatsets into the dock mount ![](images/klicky_dock_heatsets.png)
2. Using M3x8 BHCS, attach the dock mount to the B extrusion, aligning the tab in the top of the A mount with the recess in the back of the dock


# Attach the klicky dock


**Parts needed:**
* 1 6x3 magnet
* 2 M3x20 SHCS

**Printed parts:**
* 1 probe_dock

**Steps:**
1. Insert a 6x3 magnet into the probe_dock. Use a small drop of glue to prevent it from moving. The polarity of this magnet is not important right now. ![](images/klicky_dock_magnet.png)
2. Use the M3x20 SHCS to attach the dock to the mount ![](images/klicky_dock_attached.png)


# Build the klicky probe

**Parts needed:**
* 4 6x3 magnet
* 2 M2x10 self tapping screws
* 1 D2F switch

**Printed parts:**
* 1 probe_body

**Steps:**
1. Insert magnets into the top of the probe. The polarity is important, the magnets with matching colors in this picture must have the same polarity, and the one with a different color must have opposite polarity ![](images/klicky_probe_magnets_1.png)
2. Add the magnet to the back of the probe. This magnet must be aligned so that it is attracted to the magnet in the dock that was added in the previous step. The probe should snap cleanly into the dock and be retained by these magnets. Use some glue to retain these magnets in place ![](images/klicky_probe_magnets_2.png)
3. Make sure that the magnets on top of the klicky probe are flat and level, and use some glue to hold them in place
5. Remove the lever from the d2f switch. This can be done with a set of needlenose pliers, just squeeze the lever from the sides where it attaches to the switch body to release it
6. Attach the switch using 2 M2x10 self tapping screws. The legs from the switch should be in contact with the magnets on the top of the probe body
