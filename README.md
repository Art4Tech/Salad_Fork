# Salad Fork

![](images/salad-fork-hero.png)

The Salad Fork is a [Voron Trident][tridentURL] scaled down to use 1515 aluminum extrusions for the frame instead of 2020, exactly [like how the Micron][micronURL] is a [Voron 2.4][v2URL] scaled down. It is not a modification for a Voron V0, but a from-scratch build that requires longer extrusions and rails, two more V0.1 integrated-leadscrew Z motors, a higher-wattage power supply, possibly a bigger bed…

Why go to the trouble of a whole new build? Well, Salad Fork features:

- Support for build volumes of 120mm³ or 160mm³ (1.95× the build volume of a V0.1!)
- [Klicky support][klickyURL]
- [Purge bucket support][purgeBucketURL]
- Flexible toolhead support with a variety of options
- Fast preheat time compared to full-sized printers, no need to wait an hour preheating
- Optional sensorless homing
- mini-SB support
- [Boop compatibility][boopURL]

Coming soon™…

- Magnetically-attached panels
